                The rainbow lorikeet is a medium-
                sized parrot. The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper
                parts
                (wings, back and tail) are deep green. The chest is red with blue-black barring. The belly is deep
                green,
                and
                the thighs and rump are yellow with deep green barring. In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly
                with
                the red underwing coverts.

                There is little to visually distinguish between the sexes; however, to a keen observer of their
                colouring and behaviour, their dimorphism is readily apparent.
